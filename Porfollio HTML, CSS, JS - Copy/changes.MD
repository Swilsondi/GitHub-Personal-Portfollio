* Changes I want to make to the portfollio site

-Making tab links at the top take users to seperate pages instead of the a section on the same page.
-Will need a different home page to display more features and skills. So that when the user goes to the other tabs they will leave from the home page and land on wherever they clicked to go
-Updating images to reflect personal data and use. 
-Make about me section readable and navigatable. Currently Skills, experience, and education do not look like tabs that are clickable. So if im a new user to the site how would i know to click there?

-My services section/ page needs to be updated to reflect current services. Should be clickable so the user gets taken to the page with my current work. 
-Along with My work page/section needs to showcase and link other pages to other codebase files. So users can navigate to projects very easily.
-Layout may need to be changed to match user flow.
-Resume needs to be updated to download cv button. 
-No phone number should display
-And google sheets page needs to be updated and relinked to make sure it works
-My pictures and images of current tasks and work
-Lastly research other portfolios, what do they have I don't. What does their site do well? What does mine not o well? Reform refactor repeat. 
-Add my notion templates and other productivity tools for users to see on my page.
-Display tech stack and current learning roaadmap.
-blog or article section/page for retention and news related.
